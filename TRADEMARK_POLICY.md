## Logo and Trademark Policy

The brand name BEASM and the logo are trademarks of Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

### Introduction

Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Frappe) owns and oversees the trademarks for the BEASM name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the BEASM name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve BEASM.
- We’d like to make it clear how BEASM-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the BEASM name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the BEASM name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official BEASM resources.

### Frappe Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Frappe is required to use the BEASM name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the BEASM name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the BEASM software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which BEASM is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the BEASM name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use BEASM as part of a domain name.

Use of the BEASM name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other BEASM-related businesses or projects can use the BEASM name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by BEASM or Frappe Technologies or the BEASM open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering BEASM consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The BEASM Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the BEASM logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use BEASM as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around BEASM. We encourage BEASM-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the BEASM name or logo, please contact Frappe Technologies for clarification.
